# SocialGraphs2017
Documents needed to run the code for Social Graphs and Interactions 2017

Since we wanted to avoid recreating the list of the philosophers and the graph from scratch, we decided to upload these files here.
The files required to run the first part of the code have been created during Week 4 and Week 5 and are presented below.
Graph of the philosophers: 'phil_graph.txt'.

List containing all the unique philosophers: 'phil_branches_by_name.json'. 
This file is a dictionary with the philosopher names as keys and their respective branch(es) as values.

In Part II we are using 'sim_matrix.csv', which is dataset containing the similarities between the Wikipedia articles.
